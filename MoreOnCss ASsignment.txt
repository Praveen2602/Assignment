 ans----Pseudo-classes are used to select elements based on their state, such as
when the element is hovered over, when it has focus, or when it is the first or

    2.What are gradients in CSS.
    ans-- Gradient --- It lets you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:
● Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
● Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
● Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)        
           
  3.What are different types of transitions in CSS.
  ans--- The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
                  The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
● ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is
default)
● linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
● ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
● ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
● ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
● cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
