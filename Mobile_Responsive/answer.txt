    The position property in CSS determines how an element is positioned within its containing element. It has several values:
      static: Default value. The element follows the normal flow of the document.
      relative: Positioned relative to its normal position. You can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust its position.
      absolute: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (if any). Itâ€™s taken out of the normal flow.
      fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport. It remains fixed even when scrolling.
      sticky: Acts like relative until it reaches a specified threshold, then becomes fixed.

2.How many types of positioning are there in CSS?
     There are four types of positioning in CSS:
      static: Default positioning (follows normal flow).
      relative: Positioned relative to its normal position.
      absolute: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
      fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport.

3.What is â€˜z-indexâ€™ and why use it?
     z-index controls the stacking order of positioned elements. It specifies which element appears on top when they overlap.
     Higher z-index values bring an element forward. Itâ€™s useful for layering elements, like dropdown menus or modals.
