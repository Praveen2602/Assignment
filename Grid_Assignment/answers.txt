The grid is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex two-dimensional layouts for web pages. It divides the page into rows and columns, making it easier to position and align elements.

2.What is the difference between Flex and grid?
Both Flexbox and CSS Grid are layout systems, but they serve different purposes:
Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns). Itâ€™s great for arranging items within a single row or column.
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. Itâ€™s more versatile and powerful for overall page layout.


3.How can you define rows and columns for your grid?
   To define rows and columns in CSS Grid:
   Use the grid-template-rows property to specify row sizes.
   Use the grid-template-columns property to define column sizes.
   For example:

CSS
  .my-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr; /* Two rows with flexible heights */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Three columns with equal width */
}

4.List any two properties of the grid item and grid container.
  Grid Container Properties:
    display: grid; â€“ Defines an element as a grid container.
    grid-template-areas: ...; â€“ Specifies named grid areas for layout.
  Grid Item Properties:
   grid-row: ...; â€“ Determines the row placement of an item.
   grid-column: ...; â€“ Sets the column placement of an item.
