      2. What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file.
    ans---- 3 types to bring css in html file 
               1. Inline styling.
               2. Internal styling.
               3. External styling.


               ## Inline styling-----------

               Inline styling is a technique in HTML that allows you to apply style directly to an
               HTML element using the style attribute. It is called "inline" because the style is
               applied directly to the element, in the same line of HTML code.

               ##Internal styling---------------

                   Internal styling refers to the practice of using a style element within the head of
                   an HTML document to define styles for the elements on the page. The style
                   element should contain a list of CSS rules that specify the styles for the elements
                  on the page.
                   

                  ##External Styling--------------

                       External styling refers to the practice of linking to an external CSS file from an HTML
                       document using the link element. The link element should be placed within the
                      head of the HTML document, and it should have a rel attribute with a value of
                       "stylesheet" to indicate that it is linking to a style sheet.


                      3. What  yuo mean by secificity in CSS.
                      In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), specificity refers to the weight or importance
                      given to a particular selector in determining which styles should be applied to an element. 
                      It is a way of resolving conflicts that arise when multiple selectors target the same element and 
                      have different styles defined for it.
